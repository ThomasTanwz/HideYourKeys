# HideYourKeys

This little app written in bash script allows you to hide your Google Maps API key every time you push to GitHub repos.
It finds the key, replace it with a random integer and commits the code to Github. Therefore your key is hidden to public.
When it's done, it replaces back the original API key, and therefore you can work flawlessly on your machine as well.

The situation may be different for every user, therefore please LOOK INTO THE SOURCE CODE before you use it.
